### Docz error reproduction

The project structure has been generated by an ejected
[`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

One mdx file added: `./src/index.mdx`

#### Run these commands

```
npm install
npm run docz
```

The following error is produced:

```
Building app
The above error occurred in the <StoreStateProvider> component:
    in StoreStateProvider
    in App

React will try to recreate this component tree from scratch using the error boundary you provided, App.
Warning: App: Error boundaries should implement getDerivedStateFromError(). In that method, return a state update to display an error message or fallback UI.
```

#### System

```
node --version
# v12.13.0
npm --version
# 6.12.0
```
